Generate an honest risk assessment that builds investor confidence through transparency and preparedness.

## What to Generate

### Required Elements

1. **Risk inventory**  Comprehensive list of risks by category
2. **Probability/impact matrix**  Visual risk prioritisation
3. **Mitigation strategies**  How each major risk is being addressed
4. **Contingency plans**  What happens if a risk materialises
5. **Insurance coverage**  Business insurance needs and plans
6. **Regulatory risks**  Compliance obligations and penalties
7. **Key person risk**  Dependency on specific individuals

### Risk Categories

- **Market risks**  Demand shifts, market saturation, timing
- **Financial risks**  Cash flow, currency, interest rates, funding gaps
- **Operational risks**  Supply chain, technology failure, quality issues
- **Competitive risks**  New entrants, price wars, disruptive innovation
- **Regulatory risks**  Law changes, licence requirements, compliance costs
- **Team risks**  Key person departure, hiring difficulty, skill gaps
- **Technology risks**  Obsolescence, security breaches, platform dependency
- **External risks**  Economic downturn, pandemic, geopolitical instability

### Risk Matrix Format

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Risk name] | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | Score | [Strategy] |

### Mitigation Strategy Types

- **Avoid**  Eliminate the risk entirely by changing approach
- **Reduce**  Lower probability or impact through preventive action
- **Transfer**  Shift risk to third party (insurance, outsourcing)
- **Accept**  Acknowledge and monitor (for low-impact risks)

### Process Risk Identification

For operational risks, walk through each core process activity asking "What can go wrongSection " (Page, 2015). Document findings in an internal controls table before developing solutions  identify all risks first, solve second.

Use root cause analysis to move beyond symptoms to underlying causes:
- **Ishikawa (Fishbone) diagram**  Brainstorm causes across the 6 Ms: Man (people/skills), Method (process design), Machine (equipment/systems), Material (inputs/data), Measurement (metrics/feedback), Milieu (environment/culture) (Dumas et al., 2013)
- **5 Whys**  For each identified cause, ask "WhySection " repeatedly until reaching a root cause that, if eliminated, would prevent recurrence
- **Pareto analysis**  Focus on the vital 20% of causes responsible for 80% of issues

### Issue Register

For complex operational risks, maintain a structured issue register:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Issue ID | Unique identifier |
| Issue name | Short descriptive name |
| Impact dimension | Time / Cost / Quality / Flexibility affected |
| Quantitative impact | Estimated magnitude (e.g., "adds 3 days to cycle time") |
| Root causes | Underlying causes identified via Ishikawa/5 Whys |
| Suggested improvements | Potential solutions with trade-off assessment |
| Priority | High/Medium/Low based on impact and feasibility |

## Generation Process

1. Ask for: industry, business stage, key dependencies, known concerns
2. Brainstorm risks across all 8 categories
3. Assess probability and impact for each
4. Prioritise by risk level (probability x impact)
5. Develop mitigation strategy for all high and medium risks
6. Create contingency plans for top 5 risks
7. Identify insurance needs

## Quality Criteria

- Risks are specific to this business, not generic lists
- High-impact risks have detailed mitigation plans
- Contingency plans include trigger conditions ("if X happens, we do Y")
- Analysis is honest  investors distrust plans with no acknowledged risks
- Key person risk is addressed with succession or knowledge-sharing plans

### Startup-Specific Risk Factors

For new ventures, actively check for the 9 Deadly Sins (Blank & Dorf, 2012)  the most common startup failure modes:

1. Assuming "I know what the customer wants" without validation
2. Building features without customer feedback
3. Fixating on launch date over learning
4. Executing an untested plan
5. Static plans in dynamic markets
6. Hiring senior executives before finding a business model
7. Marketing to a plan without testing
8. **Premature scaling**  the #1 startup failure mode (hiring/spending before validation)
9. Management by crisis instead of systematic discovery

Use the **Assumptions Tracking Template** to quantify risk: classify each assumption as Minor/Major/Critical, calculate Risk Score = (Minor1) + (Major5) + (Critical25), target below 100 (Alam). See `references/startup-risk-frameworks.md`.

### Uganda-Specific Regulatory Risks (Standard Inclusions)

Every Uganda business plan risk analysis must include the following regulatory risks as standard items  they affect most businesses and carry significant financial penalties:

| Risk | Description | Impact if Materialised | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EFRIS non-compliance** | Failure to issue electronic fiscal receipts via URA's EFRIS system | UGX 8,000,000/month fine for not using EFRIS; UGX 6,000,000/month for not issuing e-receipts | Register for EFRIS before trading; train all sales staff; integrate EFRIS into POS system |
| **NIN/BRN licensing gate** | From 2025, individual NIN (for individuals) and BRN (for companies) are required before any licence can be issued | Inability to obtain trading licence, bank account, or government contracts | Ensure all directors have valid National IDs from NIRA; obtain BRN from URSB before applying for any licence |
| **Import cost escalation** | 2025 Finance Act introduced 1.5% Import Declaration Fee + 1.0% Railway Development Levy on CIF value of all imports | 2.5% additional cost on all imported inputs, equipment, raw materials | Prioritise local sourcing; factor import levies into COGS calculations; investigate EAC origin preferences |
| **VAT anti-fragmentation** | URA now treats artificially split transactions as single supplies for VAT threshold purposes | Unexpectedly crossing UGX 150M VAT threshold; back-taxes + penalties | Do not artificially split invoices; seek tax advice before approaching threshold |
| **Late EFRIS filing** | Late submission of EFRIS reports | UGX 200,000 or 2% of tax liability per month, whichever is higher | Calendar automated EFRIS submissions; use URA-integrated accounting software |
| **EUDR compliance** (coffee, cocoa, timber exporters) | EU Deforestation Regulation  effective December 31, 2025 | Loss of EU market access (67% of Uganda's coffee market) | Register farm GPS coordinates; obtain GlobalG.A.P. certification; implement supply chain traceability |
| **NSSF default** | Failure to remit employee social security contributions (5% employee + 10% employer) | Fine up to UGX 10M + up to 6 months imprisonment | Set up automatic NSSF payment schedule; treat NSSF as a fixed cost |

For import-dependent businesses, also model the exchange rate depreciation scenario (see `meta-financial-stress-test/references/stress-test-methodology.md`)  UGX 4,200/$ pessimistic, UGX 4,800/$ extreme scenario.
